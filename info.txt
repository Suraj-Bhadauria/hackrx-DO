version 4
will try FAISS(Local indexing) here to reduce the 
index creation time
- FAISS will not store the embeddings, instead process it in run time 
- lets try

- ai studio told that chromaDB which I am currently using 
is also in-time so no major difference will come even if
I setup in time FAISS

- but it has suggested to shift back to sentence-transformers from google api 
- strange!

-- and yes its working well now I will put it to digital ocean

- but lets see


-- I have made account on digital ocean and has bought a linux box using github education pack free credits
-- Now onwards I wont make different version folders, instead work on a single folder using git
-- Now everything is working cool, all I need to do is prompt engineering
